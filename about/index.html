        <h3>About</h3>
        <img src="./images/JoAnne Fillatti.jpg">
        <p>After many years of favoring my left brain as a plant scientist, my right brain has finally had the opportunity to flourish. Photography has enabled me to reconnect with my creative side. When I’m behind the lens composing a shot, the rest of the world fades away. It’s like being in a trance, capturing transient moments in time; a fleeting expression, a wing flap, or a receding landscape. Much of my inspiration is drawn from the natural beauty of our planet and the creatures that inhabit it. Birds are one of my favorite muses. With over 1200 species globally, the biological diversity and the kaleidoscope of colors they possess, they present an unlimited palette to compose from.</p>
        <p>While photography has always been a part of my life, the demands of career and family life took precedent for many years. Our son is probably one of the most photographed individuals on this planet! I’ve now come full circle, back to one of my early passions. As a child, I documented everything in site with my Kodak Instamatic camera. Many years later, I began mastering the basic principles of photography using my first single lens reflex camera, a Pentax Spotmatic F.   I then dabbled with black and white images for years, spending hours in the dark room processing film. Eventually I made the leap into the digital age, taking advantage of the amazing advances in technology. Now instead, I spend hours filtering through images in front of a computer screen!</p>
        <p>By sharing my images on this website, I hope to convey my fascination with the diversity and magic our planet has to offer.</p>
